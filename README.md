Ever spent hours combing through two nearly identical contracts, just to find that one sneaky clause that changed everything?  

In this hands-on bootcamp, we’ll show you how to let AI do the heavy lifting. Discover how IBM’s watsonx Orchestrate AI Agent can revolutionize document comparison, turning a tedious manual task into a fast and reliable workflow.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

In this session, you’ll:
* Learn how to orchestrate workflows in watsonx Orchestrate using a custom AI Agent and tool.
* Extract document differences through chatting to the agent.
* Discuss the possibility of using additional pre-built agents.


## 💼 Use Case: Contract Review Accelerator

Imagine you’re part of a legal team reviewing two versions of a vendor contract:
* Version A from last quarter
* Version B just received today

Instead of manually comparing every clause, your watsonx Orchestrate agent works for you:
1.	Extracts document terms.
2.	Feeds the content to the agent, which applies semantic matching and highlights critical differences (e.g., pricing, liability, renewal terms).
3.	Generates a summary report for immediate review.

In minutes, you’ll know what changed, why it matters, and what to do next.
